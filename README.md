RMarkdown Templates for CountyStat reports

## Guidelines

For the most part the two templates serve as Guidelines on how CountyStat Analysts should format their RMarkdown reports. The PDF reports are more strict as an outcome of the PDF format itself.

Little is included on how to use most of the functions and packages included, instead hyperlinks to their documentation are provided for Analysts to explore on their own to use as needed.
